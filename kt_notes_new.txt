
Meeting 1: Sales Force IT - Group Implementation E2E - AI-2024.10.22-Meeting Recording 1
This meeting focused on understanding how Salesforce, Abby, and Asus handle pricing mixer approvals. The team discussed how the current process works, what challenges exist, and how automation can improve efficiency.

The Pricing Mixer is a process that ensures pricing changes for healthcare plans are correctly applied and approved before being implemented. Currently, when a company wants to renew or modify their insurance plan, a request is created in Salesforce. The request is reviewed to determine whether a pricing mixer approval is required. If needed, a questionnaire is filled out to capture specific details related to the pricing changes.

Previously, these questionnaires were completed using Excel sheets, which caused inefficiencies and errors. To improve this, a system called Abby was introduced. Abby replaces Excel by allowing the Pricing Mixer team to capture and store all necessary pricing details electronically. After the information is entered in Abby, it is sent to Asus, which then makes the data available to the Enterprise Business Architecture (EBA) team for review.

One major issue discussed in the meeting was that Salesforce does not automatically detect whether a pricing mixer approval is required. Instead, someone has to manually check and initiate the process. This creates delays and increases the chances of human error. The proposed solution was to integrate Salesforce with Abby so that pricing mixer approvals can be triggered automatically whenever specific conditions are met.

Another issue discussed was that data related to pricing mixer approvals is spread across multiple systems, including Salesforce, Abby, Asus, and FOBS. This makes it difficult to track changes and increases the chances of discrepancies. A suggestion was made to make Abby the single source of truth for pricing mixer data, ensuring that all updates are stored in one place and can be accessed easily by different teams.

The overall goal of this meeting was to identify ways to improve efficiency by reducing manual work, automating approvals, and ensuring better integration between systems.

Meeting 2: Sales Force - Group Implementation E2E - AI-20241021_190338-Meeting Recording
This meeting continued the discussion on how pricing mixer requests are received and processed. The team explored how Salesforce identifies pricing mixer approvals, the role of Abby in capturing data, and how approvals are currently handled manually.

When a pricing change request is submitted, the first step is to determine whether the Pricing Mixer team needs to be involved. Currently, this is done through a manual review process. If a pricing mixer review is required, a pricing mixer questionnaire must be completed. The information in the questionnaire is used to assess the impact of pricing changes and ensure compliance with company policies.

The issue raised in this meeting was that the Pricing Mixer team still manually reviews each request, which is time-consuming and inefficient. The proposed solution was to automate the decision-making process within Salesforce so that pricing mixer approvals are triggered automatically when needed.

Another challenge discussed was the lack of direct integration between Salesforce and Abby. Because the two systems do not communicate directly, users must manually transfer data from one system to another. This increases the chances of errors and delays. The team discussed the possibility of integrating Salesforce and Abby so that pricing mixer data can be automatically transferred, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

The meeting also touched on the importance of making sure that pricing mixer information is easily accessible to all relevant teams. By improving integration between Salesforce, Abby, and Asus, the company can ensure that pricing data is stored in a central location and is always up to date.

Meeting 9: Pricing Mixer KT Sessions - Introduction to Mixers
This session provided an introduction to the Pricing Mixer process, explaining what it is, why it is important, and how it fits into the overall healthcare pricing and plan renewal process. Since you are new to healthcare, I will break it down in very simple terms.

The Pricing Mixer is a process used to adjust, review, and approve pricing changes for healthcare plans. Insurance plans are not static—they change over time based on costs, contracts, regulations, and market conditions. When these changes occur, the Pricing Mixer process ensures that all necessary adjustments are reviewed, approved, and properly applied before the new pricing goes live.

The session began by explaining why pricing mixers are needed. In a healthcare insurance plan, there are many moving parts, such as medical services, provider networks, hospital contracts, pharmacy benefits, and customer premiums. When any of these components change, it can impact the cost structure of the plan. For example, if hospitals increase their charges for certain procedures, or if new government regulations require additional coverage, the insurance provider must adjust its pricing accordingly.

The Pricing Mixer process helps ensure that these pricing changes are properly assessed before they are applied. The goal is to prevent sudden price fluctuations, ensure fairness, and comply with legal and contractual obligations.

The team explained that the Pricing Mixer process follows a structured workflow. When a pricing change is requested, it first needs to be evaluated to determine whether it requires a formal pricing mixer review. If it does, the request moves to the Pricing Mixer team, which conducts a detailed analysis.

A Pricing Mixer Questionnaire is used to collect key details about the requested pricing change. This questionnaire asks questions such as:

Is this a new healthcare plan or a renewal of an existing one?
Are there any changes in provider rates, reimbursement structures, or coverage details?
Will this pricing change impact any existing contracts with hospitals, doctors, or other providers?
Are there any regulatory or legal requirements that must be considered?
Previously, this questionnaire was filled out in Excel and submitted manually. However, to improve efficiency, the company has now started using Abby, a digital system that collects and processes pricing mixer information in an organized way.

Once the questionnaire is completed, the Pricing Mixer team analyzes the data to determine whether the requested pricing change is feasible, accurate, and compliant with the company’s financial and legal policies. If necessary, the team works with actuaries, finance experts, and legal advisors to make sure everything is correct.

If the pricing mixer request is approved, the new pricing details are sent to Asus and FOBS, where they are stored for implementation. If any issues are found, the request is sent back for corrections, and the process is repeated until all requirements are met.

One of the major challenges discussed in this session was how to improve the Pricing Mixer process to make it faster and more accurate. The current process still involves some manual steps, which can lead to delays and errors. The team discussed ways to automate approvals, integrate systems more effectively, and create a centralized tracking system to ensure transparency and accountability.

The session ended with an overview of how the Pricing Mixer process fits into the broader insurance pricing workflow. The team emphasized that pricing mixers are a critical part of maintaining fair, competitive, and financially sustainable healthcare plans.

The main takeaway from this session was that the Pricing Mixer is a structured process that ensures pricing changes are reviewed, approved, and implemented in a controlled manner. The move towards digital automation (using Abby, Salesforce, and Asus) aims to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and streamline the workflow.
