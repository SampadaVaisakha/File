these are the 4 excel iam having and here are the  sample records of each 
i want you to work on these 4 excel for solving my problem 

main target is to match the source file 'Logical Column Name' values to the destination file 'Attribute name' OR 'Column Name' values

example output :

Logical column name     Attribute Name    		Column Name

LAST NAME	Source Member First Name		SRC_MBR_FRST_NM
FIRST NAME	Source Member Last Name			SRC_MBR_LAST_NM
MIDDLE NAME	Source Member Middle Initial Name 	SRC_MBR_MID_INIT_NM
BIRTHDATE	Source Member Birth Date		SRC_MBR_BRTH_DT
GENDER CODE	Source Member Gender Code		SRC_MBR_GNDR_CD
DIAGNOSIS TYPECODE 1    Diagnosis 1 Code		DIAG 1 CD
DIAGNOSIS TYPECODE 2	Diagnosis 2 Code		DIAG 2 CD
DIAGNOSIS TYPECODE 3 	Diagnosis 3 Code		DIAG 3 CD
DIAGNOSIS TYPECODE 4	Diagnosis 4 Code		DIAG 4 CD
DIAGNOSIS TYPECODE 5	NaN		DIAG 5 CD
DIAGNOSIS TYPECODE 6	NaN		DIAG 6 CD
DIAGNOSIS TYPECODE 7	NaN		DIAG 7 CD
DIAGNOSIS TYPECODE 8 	NaN		DIAG 8 CD
DIAGNOSIS TYPECODE 9 	NaN		DIAG 9 CD
DIAGNOSIS TYPECODE 10 	NaN		DIAG 10 CD
DIAGNOSIS TYPECODE 11 	NaN		DIAG 11 CD
DIAGNOSIS TYPECODE 12 	NaN		DIAG 12 CD
DIAGNOSIS CODE 1 	Diagnosis 1 Code		DIAG 1 CD
DIAGNOSIS CODE 2	Diagnosis 2 Code		DIAG 2 CD
DIAGNOSIS CODE 3 	Diagnosis 3 Code		DIAG 3 CD
DIAGNOSIS CODE 4	Diagnosis 4 Code		DIAG 4 CD
DIAGNOSIS CODE 5	NaN		DIAG 5 CD
DIAGNOSIS CODE 6	NaN		DIAG 6 CD
DIAGNOSIS CODE 7	NaN		DIAG 7 CD
DIAGNOSIS CODE 8 	NaN		DIAG 8 CD
DIAGNOSIS CODE 9 	NaN		DIAG 9 CD
DIAGNOSIS CODE 10 	NaN		DIAG 10 CD
DIAGNOSIS CODE 11 	NaN		DIAG 11 CD
DIAGNOSIS CODE 12 	NaN		DIAG 12 CD
i hope you understood the output approach

first i want you to remove the duplicates in 
source file: 'Physical Column Description', 'Logical Column Name'
destination file: 'Column Name', 'Attribute Description'

then you should normalize the string 
if there are any special chars remove and also there are nan values in the excel
except destination file:  'Attribute Description' if there are nan values in any other files handle them or remove
we have nan in attribute column, but if we replace it with any string then it would check the match with that string and source value which may lead to less match and ignore the column name value which is actually the best match
so handle such cases properly with your knowledge

later step
apply the mappings like for the source or destination file words check if there is any shortcut or alternative word which can help to match correctly
example:


PDPD ID is prod id or product id which can actually match with product id	PROD_ID
checking the match with PDPD is difficult but checking the match for Product/ prod is easy to match correctly

SGSG ID
for this the alternate word is SURGRP as per the elv_mapping excel so we can check for subgrp id
I hope you understand 


next step is to extract the number from the source value if any and return the prefix word and number
now I can think this can work easily:
first if you take the number and get all the matches for the number and then check the match for the prefix having that number 
example:

the input word 'DIAGNOSIS CODE 9'
number extracted 9 checking the matched words with 9 
#N/A	CUM LINE PRSNT_ON_ADMSN_9_CD
#N/A	CLM_LINE PRSNT ON ADMSN 19 CD
#N/A	SRC_CLM_LINE_PRSNT_ON_ADMSN_9_CD
#N/A	SRC_CLM_LINE_PRSNT_ON_ADMSN_19_CD
#N/A	CNDTN 9 CD
#N/A	DIAG_9_CD
#N/A	DIAG 19_CD
#N/A	ICD_PROC_9_CD
#N/A	ICD_PROC_9_DT
#N/A	OCRNC_9_CD
#N/A	OCRNC_9_DT

these are the matches having 9 in the word and now ceck for the prefix match 'DIAGNOSIS CODE'
#N/A	DIAG_9_CD
#N/A	DIAG 19_CD
here Is the matches the number is only 9 so the first will the highest match 2nd match would be this #N/A	DIAG 19_CD
so I want you to do it step by step so that we can achieve the accuracy 100%

keeping all this in mind please help me to achieve the best results
